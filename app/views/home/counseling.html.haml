            Hourly A la Carte Services & Series Packages

            If you are interested in one-to-one college counseling sessions without an expensive and binding annual contract, hourly "a la carte" services enable you to target one or two areas of the college planning process at a time and pay as you go. If you plan to meet more than once an academic year [June to June], you will likely find the three series package valuable.
