            Excelling in middle and high school and applying to college is no easy task. In fact, it can be quite stressful on teens. In today’s competitive admissions landscape the question remains: How can students stand out in a crowded applicant pool and gain admission to increasingly selective colleges and universities?

            While many traditional college counselors require a costly long-term contract in order to retain their services, Bree’s approach to educational consulting breaks the mold. The following grade-level overviews shed light on Bree Koziara's approach to hourly college planning.
