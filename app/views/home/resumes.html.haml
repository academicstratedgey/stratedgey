            Strong writing skills are critical to success. Not only does writing equip students with the communication and critical thinking skills they will need to excel in middle school, high school, college, and beyond, writing is the primary basis upon which their learning and intellect will be judged.

            Although students are required to write in nearly every one of their classes and their teachers expect them to know how to write well, students are struggling with writing. According to a recent Department of Education survey, 54% of eighth-graders and 52% of twelfth-graders performed at the Basic (lowest) level in writing. Only 3% of eighth- and twelfth-graders performed at the Advanced (highest) level (NCES).

            Parents, educators, and policymakers agree that writing is important; yet there is a difference between setting standards or defining expectations and actually teaching students how to write.

            Bree Koziara, Ed.M. Harvard University and Founder of Academic StratEDGEy will teach you how to become a better writer through a series of skill-building workshops that make writing formulaic.
