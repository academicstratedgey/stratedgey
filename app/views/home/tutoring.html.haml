            While colleges evaluate applicants' leadership & character development, students' Grade Point Average (GPA) and standardized test scores play an even more important role in the admission process. This means students' academic performance should be their top priority throughout middle and high school. Sometimes this is easier said than done and students can benefit from a favorable learning environment and expert instruction. Through convenient and impactful hourly sessions, we focus on academic improvement and confidence building. The goal: to provide students with the information and guidance they need to excel academically while reducing their stress level.

                                As AP (Advanced Placement) courses, AP World History and AP U.S. History are considered college-level courses. While the ‘Advanced’ designation signals rigor, a GPA boost, and the possibility of earning college credit, it also means more work, greater responsibility, and higher expectations. Many students look back on their AP History courses as the most difficult courses they took in high school, which makes putting in the time and effort all the more important.
