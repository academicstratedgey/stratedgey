            %h2.red-strong Letter to Students & Parents
        .bordered-panel.large-12.columns                
            %h2.red-strong Excelling in middle and high school and gaining admission to increasingly selective colleges and universities is no easy task. In fact, it can be quite stressful on teens.
            %p.normal
                Both parents and high school students recognize the importance of going to college. Not only is a college degree more valuable than ever before, graduates reap a number of long-term benefits ranging from higher earnings to better health to higher levels of civic engagement. Yet the college admission game has changed significantly in the past twenty years becoming more complex and competitive than ever before. Between juggling coursework, participating in extracurricular activities, and preparing for high-stakes exams, teens today are overworked, over-scheduled, and overstressed. According to the American Psychological Association, 83% of teenagers report school as a somewhat or significant source of stress and 27% report extreme stress during the school year, which takes a toll on high school students’ health and development. 
            
            %h2.red-strong The path to higher education also coincides with one of the most critical transitions in the life span -- adolescence. This makes navigating the path to college and career all the more difficult. 
            %p.normal
                Characterized by a tremendous pace in growth, this transition from childhood to adulthood takes place between 10 and 19 and affects individuals’ physical, cognitive, and socioemotional development. During middle and high school, students undergo puberty, develop a growing capacity for abstract thought, expand their intellectual interests, are increasingly influenced by their peer group, and struggle with sense of identity. Not unlike adolescent development, the college admission process requires students to define themselves and their goals, which can be quite difficult. 

            %h2.red-strong In today’s competitive admission landscape the question remains: How can students stand out in a crowded applicant pool? 
            %p.normal
                In order to stand out, students must excel both inside and outside of the classroom. Students’ background and academic performance, coupled with their interests and activities will help them to develop a compelling personal narrative that helps garner the attention of college admission officers. All of this requires students to spend their time wisely and to engage in their academic journey. Increased engagement is linked to improved academic performance, higher SAT scores, better self-esteem, and a greater sense of belonging. In theory, students know they should get good grades, earn high test scores, and build a resume that demonstrates leadership and strong character. In practice, this task is much easier said than done. Studies show students become more disengaged from school as they progress from elementary to middle to high school. By high school, up to 60% of students are disengaged and feel they do not have what it takes to succeed. Even the most dedicated students and parents are left feeling overwhelmed by the prospect of applying to college. 

            %h2.red-strong Unfortunately, the answer is often found in hindsight.
            %p.normal
                By the time high school students begin filling out college applications in the fall of their senior year, many begin to understand the nature of the admission game: the college admission process begins years before students physically fill out a single application. In fact, the information and essays students share with college admission officers are simply records of past actions. Whether informed or not, students make a series of decisions throughout middle and high school that impact their choices and chances of college admission. Looking back, seniors often spot the classes that hurt their GPA, which could have been avoided; the activities that took up so much time, but were not enjoyable or meaningful; the skills that could have improved their academic performance and increased their standardized test scores, had they been cultivated. By the time students fill out their applications, these missteps and missed opportunities are in the past and out of candidates' control. 

            %h2.red-strong The expression 'hindsight is 20/20' reminds us that perspective and experience can bring clarity; so can professional guidance and support. 
            %p.normal
                While high school counselors are expected to be responsible for students’ academic, personal, social, and career development, they are overburdened and under-trained. The American Counseling Association recommends a ratio of 250 students to 1 counselor. The national average is 471:1. In California, it is 1,016 students to 1 counselor. Instead of learning the hard way and living with stress or regret, parents and students can find the help they need in Bree Koziara, Founder, President of Academic StratEDGEy.

            %p.normal
                While the application process can be difficult and anxiety invoking, it can also provide a wonderful experience of self-discovery. We envision a world in which well-guided individuals make strategic decisions about their future. In pursuing their passions and being thoughtful about their academic and extracurricular choices, these applicants will find their fit and be rewarded for their efforts.
